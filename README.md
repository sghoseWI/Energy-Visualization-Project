# PV System Size and Cost by Type Visualization:

This chart shows how the total size (in Kilowatts) and cost (in US dollars) by type of PV system (Agricultural, Commercial, Education, Government, Nonprofit, or Residential) varies by project.  The underlying data was sourced from the National Renewable Energy Laboratory.  In this chart, we are able to nicely compare the distribution of PV system sizes for different purposes -- as well as to get a sense of how much per unit (Watt) these systems cost for each of the different types of systems.  


# Average Income by State Visualization:

In this visualization, we can see a census level histogram of average income by state.  The data here was obtained by Stanford's DeepSolar Project (which uses a neural network model to classify satellite imagery of photo voltaic systems).  The goal of this visualization is to get an understanding of wealth distribution by state -- with the goal of overlaying/comparing pollution and pv system installation data.  I am interested in understanding what, if any, relationship exists between citizen income distributions by state and pollution/pv investment data over time.  


# PV System Size by State Visualization:

This chart shows how the total size (in Kilowatts) by state and time of photo voltaic installations measured by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory.  The states displayed correpond to the five most populous states (according to the US Census: https://www.census.gov/data/tables/2017/demo/popest/state-total.html). The insights drawn from this chart are interesting because it provides a sense of just how far ahead California is, according to available data, in terms of the size of its PV system investments over time.  

Note: Limited the chart to show year data to 2016 because data past that year is not comprehensive in each relevant state.
